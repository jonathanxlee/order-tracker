# Order Tracker

This application should be able to identify emails in your gmail inboc that involve orders and display the status 
of these orders within a web app 

##Status 10/12/19 

I have figured out how to parse the text from an email, and I am not going to transition into being able to extract all the information I would need to be able to track (the order number, the company with which the order was placed, the tracking number, etc.).

I am currently developing an understanding of the gmail api so that I can understand the structure of receiving messages from the users inbox. I am working on being able to read messages since they are returned in an encoded format.
