# Order Tracker

This application should be able to identify emails in your gmail inboc that involve orders and display the status 
of these orders within a web app

After consulting with a professional, I decided to restructure my design process to be more in-depth. I am changing my course of action to begin with the design of the application and then work towards the back-end functionality. I also want to begin prototyping with the fundamentals and then expand. Because of this, the repo will be a little messy for a while as I seek to restructure.

I have figured out how to parse the text from an email, and I am not going to transition into being able to extract all the information I would need to be able to track (the order number, the company with which the order was placed, the tracking number, etc.).

I am currently developing an understanding of the gmail api so that I can understand the structure of receiving messages from the users inbox. I am working on being able to read messages since they are returned in an encoded format.
